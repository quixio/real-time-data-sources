# Real time data sources

We are excited to introduce our new collection of real-time data sources, this will be a comprehensive and diverse set of data streams that can be accessed through various protocols such as Kafka, MQTT, Websockets API, and direct connections to numerous vendors in the modern data stack. This collection is designed to provide you with a wealth of real-time information, enabling you to get started and explore the possibilities of real-time data processing without the fuss of finding a data source to use.

Our collection is not just a resource, but a collaborative platform. We believe in the power of community and shared knowledge, and we invite you to contribute to this growing collection. You can collaborate by forking this GitHub repository and submitting a pull request. Whether you have a unique data source to add, or insights and experiences to share about using these real-time data streams, your collaboration will enrich this resource and our community.

As a token of our appreciation for your collaboration, we are offering $200 of credit added to your Quix platform account. Plus, we're giving you an additional 30 days to use these credits. This is our way of saying thank you for helping us make this collection a valuable resource for everyone in the data community.
