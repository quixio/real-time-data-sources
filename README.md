# Introducing Quix Real-time data sources

To learn stream processing, it helps to have a real-time data source to practice on. Unfortunately, there arenâ€™t as many public sources for real-data data as there are for historical data. We plan to change that by hosting many real-time data sources ourselves which are easily accessible via our own quixstreams Python library or by public websockets.

## Summary of current data sources


|Name   |Websocket Address   |Summary   |
|---|---|---|
|[Customer support chat stream](#customer-support-chat-stream)    |wss://ai-chat-wss-demo-realtimedatasources-prod.deployments.quix.io/timeseries   |A continuous stream of chat messages between virtual customers and virtual customer support agents who work at a fictitious electronics retailer. The conversations generated by LLama2 AI Agents.   |

## Data source Details

Each data source produces a distinct data structure and generates data in different ways. Here you can find more details on how each of the sources work:

### Customer support chat stream
This is a continuous stream of chat messages from interactions between virtual customers and virtual customer support agents who work at a fictitious electronics retailer. Both the customers and the support agents are powered by large language models (Llama2 via llama-cpp) hosted in serverless containers. The customers are prompted to ask for help about recent purchases using various tones of voice and the support agents are prompted to politely assist them.

This data source consists of 2 AI's using a Llama model from hugging face. One AI is a customer who is having a problem with a recently purchased electronic item. The other AI is a support agent at ACME Electronics.

The chats are available via this websocket API: `wss://ai-chat-wss-demo-realtimedatasources-prod.deployments.quix.io/timeseries`
